                        Before getting started to code, you have to create a file which must be<strong> lowercase </strong>, as well as your folder.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Define a <code>&lt;!DOCTYPE.html&gt;</code> at the top of the document.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        Every start tag, do not forget to start with ( &lt; ) and to end with ( > ).<br>The same in ending tag, open with( &lt;/ ) and close with( > ).
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Element:</b> Usualy consists of a start tag and an end tag, with the content inserted in
                        between. Make sure that you know the meaning of the element which you use, like <strong>strong</strong> and <b>bold</b> tags.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Headings:</b> Your <code>&lt;h1&gt;</code> - <code>&lt;h6&gt;</code> should be appeared to make title or subtitle only. Don't use it for <b>Bold</b>, <b>Big</b> and <b><small>Small</small></b>
                        letter.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Paragraph:</b> Closing <code>&lt;/p&gt;</code> tag mustn't be forgotten. Never make <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> descendent of other <code>&lt;p&gt;</code> tag.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Comment:</b> It is good to use a comment in a document but remember that it will not apper in the browser.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Link: </b>Not only URL can be in the link but also it can be <b>image</b>, but make sure that you use the apropriate link. <br> Without a forward slash at the end of subfolder addresses, you might generate two requests to the server.<br> Many servers will automatically add a forward slash to the end of the address, and then create a new request.<br>
                        <b>Do not forget to use <q>...</q></b>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Section:</b> Do not use <b>section</b> as like an element that can be used whatever the descendent, but use it for sectioning document.<br> As an example, a navigation menu should be wrapped in a <code>&lt;nav&gt;</code> element, but a list of search results and a map display and its controls don't have specific elements, and could be put inside a <b>section</b>.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Form:</b> Every time you create an html form, you must start it by using
                        <code>&lt;html&gt;</code> element, then nesting all content inside.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>
                        <b>Inline markup:</b> It's a good idea to tell your computer how to read by using inline, but make sure that you nest it properely, like using <code>&lt;button&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;kbd&gt;</code>, that you may get errors.
                    </p>

# **learning-html**
## [learning.html](https://tiaraha-funny.github.io/learning-html/)

In this project, we are going to learn about HTML.

We will see the information in these files:

- [Index](#some-hints)
- [Elements](#sections)
- [Rules](#pages)
- [Tips](#getting-started)


## What slould be seen in this website

We won't be creating all the possible pages in this website. Instead, we'll be building at least the following 6 example pages:

- Homepage
- List of all HTML rules
  - Nesting rules in detail
  - Attribute rules in detail
- List of all the HTML5 elements
- Tips for writing HTML

## Getting start

Create and push the `gh-pages` branch, and enable 'GitHub Pages' on that branch in the repo settings.
Use `master` as your default development branch, only merging to `gh-pages` when you're ready to publish your changes.
You need to work on master.

## What will be mark on:

The project will be evaluated on:

- The use of English (Spelling, Grammar)
- The code cleanliness (Is it easy to read, and free of garbage?)
- The use of HTML elements (Did you use the correct HTML element? Could you have used an HTML element where there is none?)
- The Git commits, pushes, branch use.

## Enjoy!ðŸ¤“
